This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 
```{r}
x <- read.lp("Assessment2.lp")
x
solve(x)
get.objective(x)
get.variables(x)
get.constraints(x)
get.sensitivity.objex(x)
get.sensitivity.rhs(x)

##for the objective function, I tried a few different techniques. I added together all the values for each person so they would only have one value. I also tried them all individually. Adding together Prior Experience and Undergrad degree seemed to give the best answer.

#the first set of constraints are for the groups. one group will have three people while the other two groups will have four.

#the second set of constraints is to only allow each person to be in one group.
